# SASRec Spotify Playlist Predictor

This project implements a transformer-based sequential recommendation system (SASRec) trained on the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (MPD). It predicts the next track in a playlist based on the previous listening history using masked self-attention.

## Features

* Converts raw Spotify MPD JSON into userâ€“track interaction sequences
* Implements SASRec (Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation)
* Trains on historical sequences to model user behavior
* Outputs top-10 next-track predictions based on playlist context

---

## Dataset

* **Source**: Spotify MPD (Recsys Challenge 2018)
* **Format**: `mpd.slice.0-999.json`
* The script processes this JSON into a CSV:

  ```csv
  user_id,track_id,timestamp
  ```

---

## Model: SASRec

* Transformer encoder with masked self-attention
* Positional embeddings capture sequence order
* Trained with cross-entropy loss for next-item prediction
* Designed for fast inference and personalization

### Architecture

* Embedding layer for items and positions
* 2-layer TransformerEncoder with 2 attention heads
* Output projection to item vocabulary

## Reference

Based on the [SASRec paper (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09781) by Amazon Research. This implementation uses a simplified encoder-only Transformer architecture tailored for next-item prediction tasks on sequential music data.
